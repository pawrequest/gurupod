        "{\"notes\":[\"It's finally here! In what has to be our most meta episode to date, Matt and Chris tackle the meta-philosophy / meta-spirituality / meta-science that is Sensemaking. You might say sensemaking is sense to the power of 2. But what is sensemaking, really? Well, that's a tricky question because as Jordan Hall says; no one can simply be told what sensemaking is. It is the escape hatch out of The Matrix, it is the finger pointing at the moon, it is a possibility space in an nth dimensional cube.... whatever the hell it is, some people are pretty sure it's the solution to all of humanity's problems. Exciting!\",\"So, since defining sensemaking is like trying to staple a jellyfish to a wall, it is very understandable that Jordan Hall, Jamie Wheal, and Daniel Schmachtenberger would take 2 hours and 40 minutes out of their busy schedule, and have a meta-conversation about this meta-topic, where they try to decipher exactly what this strange beast is and do some sensemaking about sensemaking. And it's even MORE understandable that Chris Kavanagh and Matthew Browne would take even longer out of their own schedules to try to analyse THAT discourse: sensemaking about sensemaking about sensemaking. \",\"Shifting to power notation for brevity, this episode is sensemaking cubed, which equals sense to the power of 4. How did we go? Well, sensemaking is like an elephant and everybody's got a piece of it.

You know you've got white fragility if you refuse to accept the truth of white fragility. Also, all white people have it. So that's pretty straightforward at least. How do you fight the curse of whiteness? Well, it's a lifelong journey of 'Doing the Work', but one thing's for sure: it starts with reading books like White Fragility and attending seminars well... like hers.\",\"DiAngelo's been out of the discourse recently, as far as we can tell, busy beavering away on new books like Nice Racism: How Progressive White People Perpetuate Racial Harm and dismantling white supremacy via corporate group therapy sessions.

Now we don't even have to cover a Guru just announce that we will and the spiral occurs.

Dennett rose to public prominence as one of the so-called four horsemen of the New Athiest movement but he always seemed slightly out of place with that cohort. Dennett's is most certainly a guru in the sense that he offers big picture 'what does it all mean' lectures linking together consciousness, intelligence, the emergence of complexity and evolution. But is there some substance there? Or does his appeal hinge on on intuitively-satisfying cosmic woo offered by less reputable figures.\",\"On a positive note, he seemed to be more interested in academic and philosophical debates than the latest culture war outrage.

Most interestingly, while scientists with specific domain expertise seem to be building a consensus towards the former, public opinion appears to be trending towards the latter. This delta between expert and popular opinion has been helped along by the frothy discourse in mainstream and social media, with most figures that we cover in this podcast dead-set certain that it came from a lab. \",\"Most recently, Sam Harris hosted on his Making Sense podcast the molecular biologist Alina Chan and. science writer Matt Ridley, spokespersons for the lab leak case, and authors of \\\"Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19\\\". To a layperson, and certainly to Sam, they put forward a rather watertight case. Intrinsic to the arguments advanced were the ideas that (a) experts in the area were refusing to engage with and unable to answer their arguments, and (b) a strong implication that there is a conspiracy of silence among virologists not just in China but internationally, to suppress the lab leak hypothesis.\",\"So, as a case study in the public understanding of science, it seems like a pretty pickle indeed.

His work focuses on the genomes of viruses, using molecular and computational biology, to understand the origins, emergence and control of pandemics.

        "{\"notes\":[\"In a kind of meta cross-over with our Decoding Academia series, we're going to decode a journal club discussion between two well-known health optimisers: Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Andrew Huberman. So you get to listen to two academics talk about two other academics talk about academic papers... we know...\",\"We've already been introduced to the bulging biceps and morning sun-drenched routines of Huberman elsewhere but this is our first introduction to Peter Attia, MD. Attia is a former ultra-endurance athlete and a physician in the field of longevity and performance, a podcaster (who isn't amirite?!?) and author of \\\"Outlive: The Science And Art Of Longevity\\\".\",\"Attia introduces us to a paper that casts doubt on the supposed general life-extending properties of a diabetes drug called Metformin. This is a drug that is apparently very well known in the biohacker/life extension communities and one that Attia administered to himself for a number of years despite the rather preliminary evidence. This is the first of many indicators that both gentlemen are certainly on the bleeding edge of self-medicating experimentation, doggedly pursuing the elusive goals of huge pectoral muscles, minds that laugh at the concept of cognitive decline, and bodies that will live... well for a lot longer than Matt and Chris!\",\"We get to hear about week-long starvation regimes, medications that take the edge of pizza and doughnut binges, dealing with month-long nausea from self-dosing experimental treatments, and frequent prick-blood tests all for the sake of optimising, optimising, optimising...\",\"Huberman's paper (a preprint, actually) falls more into the \\\"big, if true\\\" category - although he seems fairly confident himself. Does *believing* you are getting a treatment generate the relevant physiological and neurological effects in the body that could mean we can bypass the need for certain pharmacological substances entirely, including some vaccines?!? Based on the results of a small-N, fMRI study that reports mixed results, Huberman muses... maybe! Or how about those other small-N studies, with p-values hovering suspiciously close to 0.05 that report other counterintuitive findings? We will leave it to Huberman to explain.\",\"But the bad stuff aside, Huberman and Attia (especially Attia) actually do a pretty decent job talking about how to approach research papers and some of the pros and cons of different approaches. Chris and Matt thus have ample opportunities to give credit where credit's due and demonstrate that they are the fair-minded souls everyone knows them to be! \",\"In any case, it's an interesting peak into an alternative health optimiser world. It seems to be a  rather \\\"serious\\\" hobby a bit like body modification or tattoos. But who are we to judge? Matt likes cultivating succulent plants and Chris is into eating sushi in lush forests. So biohacking, self-experimentation for longevity? Well, at least it's an ethos.\",\"Also featuring, an introduction that covers Irish history, the most humble guru in the gurusphere, and our very own theory of guru cringeosity!\"],\"url\":\"https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/episode/andrew-huberman-and-peter-attia-optimising-your-pizza-binges\",\"links\":{\"Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A\",\"The Most Arrogant thing Bret Weinstein has ever said?

        "{\"notes\":[\"Andrew Huberman, Stanford academic and host of a science-themed podcast, recently released an episode on Autism with guest Dr. Karen Parker. Considering the prevalence of misinformation about vaccines and autism and this episode being promoted as providing an overview of the topic, we were interested to see how the topic would be covered. In part, this interest was because of Huberman's strategic choice to avoid any discussion, let alone any recommendation, of COVID vaccines during the pandemic. The topic came up 2 hours and 43 minutes into the episode and lasted for around 10 minutes.\",\"What we found was interesting and we think deserving of a mini-decoding. What you will not find here is any endorsement of lurid anti-vax claims or cheers for Andrew Wakefield. Indeed, Huberman notes that Wakefield's research was debunked, while his guest Dr. Parker explains the consensus view amongst researchers that there is no evidence of a link. What you will find: Huberman readily engaging in \u2018both sides\u2019 hedging: maybe Wakefield\u2019s research helped locate real issues with preservatives, maybe there are too many childhood vaccines (some clinicians 'in private' recommend none), maybe new data will come out later that reveals a link between autism and vaccines. There certainly are a lot of questions and could it be that 'cancel culture' is the real problem here rather than the existence of a very influential anti-vaccine movement?\",\"Let's just say, when you pair this with Huberman's comments on the potential dangers of Bluetooth headphones/sunscreen, the potential benefits for negative ion bathing and grounding, the lab leak origins of COVID, endorsement of AG1 and a host of other supplements, and fawning over figures like RFK Jnr and Joe Rogan... we have some questions of our own.\"],\"url\":\"https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/episode/mini-decoding-huberman-on-vaccine-autism-controversy\",\"links\":{\"Huberman Lab 154: Dr. Karen Parker- The Causes & Treatments for Autism\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccrbE0QHy94\",\"Vaccine Schedules from the 1940s to 2019\":\"https://vaxopedia.org/2019/07/09/vaccine-schedules-from-the-1940s-to-2019/amp/\",\"BMJ: How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed\":\"https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347\",\"Jonathan Jarry: Andrew Huberman Has Supplements on the Brain\":\"https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking-health-and-nutrition/andrew-huberman-has-bad-case-supplement-brain\",\"Huberman's comments on Instagram about RFK Jnr\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/andrewhuberman/comments/14c7jn3/a_long_time_coming_but_not_surprised/\"},\"date\":\"2023-12-28T00:00:00\",\"id\":109,\"title\":\"Mini-Decoding: Huberman on the Vaccine-Autism Controversy\",\"episode_number\":\"90\"}"

BBC report of what IDF showed them, including picture of arms behind MRI machine at Shifa Hospital: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67436154](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67436154)\\n\\nIn Video 1, circa 0:06, IDF soldiers are shown unloading boxes prominently labeled \\\"Medical Supplies\\\" and \\\"Baby Food\\\" for delivery to the hospital.  However, one of the pro-Palestinian folk commented, in theater we learn to put weight in our props so they won't look like that, and yeah, when you point it out, the boxes do look kind of light when one of the soldiers catches one.  Could they contain nothing but air?  I don't know.  I suppose air is a medical supply anyway.  If that's really what the boxes contain.\\n\\nBut even more interesting, is circa 0:20, one of those boxes is carried by a soldier to the hospital, escorted by several others.  An interesting escort.  Moreover...\\n\\nIn video 2, circa 0:23, IDF Lieutenant Colonel John Conricus brings our attention to a gun behind an MRI machine.  But look again, *what's behind the gun?*\\n\\nCNN, I think, noted that in the Fox News and BBC photos (link 3) there are 2 guns instead of the 1 Conricus showed.  But what I would really like to know is *where's the box?*\\n\\nI think I've avoided sensationalism which unfortunately I don't always do.  Nothing much here, old news, small detail, who cares.

The pro-Palestinian folk have already applied their skepticism from which this derives.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway, here are 2 IDF videos and a BBC report on what the IDF showed them:</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Twitter feed from IDF embedded reporter, video released by IDF showing them delivering aid to Shifa hospital: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1724728335253553246\\\">https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1724728335253553246</a></li>\\n<li> Widely released video of IDF spokesperson Conricus showing arms stored behind an MRI machine at Shifa hospital: <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFmYWkquozk\\\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFmYWkquozk</a>.  This one is I think from the Telegraph, a British news outlet.</li>\\n<li>BBC report of what IDF showed them, including picture of arms behind MRI machine at Shifa Hospital: <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67436154\\\">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67436154</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>In Video 1, circa 0:06, IDF soldiers are shown unloading boxes prominently labeled &quot;Medical Supplies&quot; and &quot;Baby Food&quot; for delivery to the hospital.  However, one of the pro-Palestinian folk commented, in theater we learn to put weight in our props so they won&#39;t look like that, and yeah, when you point it out, the boxes do look kind of light when one of the soldiers catches one.  Could they contain nothing but air?  I don&#39;t know.  I suppose air is a medical supply anyway.  If that&#39;s really what the boxes contain.</p>\\n\\n<p>But even more interesting, is circa 0:20, one of those boxes is carried by a soldier to the hospital, escorted by several others.  An interesting escort.  Moreover...</p>\\n\\n<p>In video 2, circa 0:23, IDF Lieutenant Colonel John Conricus brings our attention to a gun behind an MRI machine.  But look again, <em>what&#39;s behind the gun?</em></p>\\n\\n<p>CNN, I think, noted that in the Fox News and BBC photos (link 3) there are 2 guns instead of the 1 Conricus showed.  But what I would really like to know is <em>where&#39;s the box?</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I think I&#39;ve avoided sensationalism which unfortunately I don&#39;t always do.  Nothing much here, old news, small detail, who cares.    Just asking questions.</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->\",\"likes\":null,\"suggested_sort\":null,\"banned_at_utc\":null,\"view_count\":null,\"archived\":false,\"no_follow\":false,\"spam\":false,\"is_crosspostable\":true,\"pinned\":false,\"over_18\":false,\"media_only\":false,\"can_gild\":false,\"removed\":false,\"spoiler\":false,\"locked\":false,\"author_flair_text\":null,\"visited\":false,\"removed_by\":null,\"mod_note\":null,\"distinguished\":null,\"subreddit_id\":\"t5_400gsf\",\"author_is_blocked\":false,\"mod_reason_by\":null,\"num_reports\":1,\"removal_reason\":null,\"link_flair_background_color\":\"\",\"id\":\"18omm71\",\"is_robot_indexable\":true,\"discussion_type\":null,\"num_comments\":287,\"send_replies\":true,\"whitelist_status\":\"all_ads\",\"contest_mode\":false,\"author_patreon_flair\":false,\"approved\":true,\"author_flair_text_color\":null,\"permalink\":\"/r/DecodingTheGurus/comments/18omm71/sam_harris_and_israel_vs_hamas_and_confirmation/\",\"parent_whitelist_status\":\"all_ads\",\"stickied\":false,\"url\":\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DecodingTheGurus/comments/18omm71/sam_harris_and_israel_vs_hamas_and_confirmation/\",\"subreddit_subscribers\":18408,\"created_utc\":1703272602.0,\"num_crossposts\":0,\"media\":null,\"is_video\":false,\"_fetched\":false},\"id\":34,\"title\":\"Sam Harris and Israel vs Hamas and confirmation bias\",\"created_datetime\":\"2023-12-22T19:16:42\"}",
